                    <p>From the very beginning the web was just plain text and links, already then people thought it was amazing that we could communicate to the world through writing and reading text and it was something that actually stayed there and we could re-visit again and again. From then until now the web has developed tremendous to the better and the internet also play a role in here.  The internet access to people has grown significantly and almost everyone in the world who have access to a cellphone/ computer/ tablet and so on have access to the internet. I believe that in five years even more people have access to the internet and the web.</p>

                <div class="col-lg-10">
                    <p>Except from plain text and links the web today have pictures, videos, sounds that is interactive with the end user. You can for example click on something and then scroll down automatically to the content for the link. I think in five years people will come up with cooler and more crazy UI designs than there already is since new techniques are coming up and the web are constantly changing and evolving.</p>

                    <p>Something else that wasn’t possible before is online shopping. Today you can order anything from the internet for example food, clothes, tickets etc. In the future people will expand their business to the web and make smart stuff for their business that is connected to internet.</p>

                    <p>Already now we can check our bank account in our cellphones. What if we could check other stuff in apps or websites that is connected to the internet? For example, I have a water turtle that needs to be fed once a day. Maybe one day I’m not at home but I have invented something that feeds my water turtle through a web or mobile application. Through that application I only need internet to connect to my device at home and I can feed my water turtle even though I’m not there. What I mean is more products will go through the web since we people are smart but lazy ones that loves to make life more comfortable.</p>
